# BIG BIG DISCLAIMER

This is a fork of the OSINT-Framework project by lockfale. That project contains a lot of deprecated information and there don't seem to be any responses on people's pull requests. This is an attempt to make a version that works for at least me, but hopefully also for others. The framework is awesome, it just needs some polish and a lot of love. A few quality-of-life updates are required, like a changelog on the main page, dark-mode toggle, accessiblity options, 'collapse all'-button, etc. In the coming weeks, I will be working on a list of requirements and functionalities to base a plan on. 

I am not a programmer by trade. Javascript is very new to me and I don't understand most of the code in this project. But it's a fun and practical way to work on those skills. No socials, because I prefer to remain as anonymous as I can. If you have any suggestions, please let me know through an Issue. I will not collaborate with anyone just yet, mostly because I'm not confident in my own skills as a programmer. But I do appreciate your input, so thank you in advance. <3

## Notes (copied from original project)
OSINT framework focused on gathering information from free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a portion of the available information for no cost.
